    source_url: /tdlm/sources
    tables:
      attempts:
        columns:
          PO (presentation order): the order in which the contestant's prize, VT, work of art, or live attempt was presented; 0 for simultaneous (most live tasks)
          ± (adjustment): any alteration (bonus or deduction) applied to the attempt's base score
          episode: the contestant's cumulative episode score after this task
          series: 〃
      discrepancies:
        columns:
          ?: This table exists to account for the two whole points that have gone misplaced in the history of TMUK.
      episodes:
        columns:
          tasks: the number of "standard" tasks (those having five judged attempts) in this episode
      measurements:
        columns:
          measurement: A value of "?" indicates that no conclusive measurement was given, with null used to signify a DNF/DQ. Note that times are stored internally as seconds but presented in D:HH:MM:SS format.
      normalized_scores:
        columns:
          rigid: 'the simplest possible normalization: 5 points for 1st (equal), 4 for 2nd (equal), etc.; null for team tasks (only two ranks)'
          spread: Distribute points from a pool of {5, 4, 3, 2, 1}, with rank ties between N people sharing the next N available point values. (〃)
          scale: Multiply every score by some common factor to achieve a sum of 15 for the task; where this causes any individual score to exceed 5, regrettably abandon the 15-point target and scale down to ensure a maximum of 5. Note that this value does exist for team tasks due to being point- rather than rank-based.
          5+3, 3+2, 3½+2½: various ways to normalize team tasks based on rank

        columns:
          location: Note that this is specifically the location of the task brief (except in cases of the Knappett being involved), which is generally but not always where the bulk of a task took place.
          std: 1 for "standard" tasks (those having five judged attempts), 0 otherwise
